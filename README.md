# Trilium Reading List Sender
Trilium Reading List Sender is a simple Android application for adding books, 
articles, etc. to lists written on [TriliumNext Notes](https://github.com/TriliumNext/notes).

Lists cannot be viewed. This app only appends new items to your lists.

If you want to access your lists on mobile, you can use TriliumNext's 
[mobile frontend](https://triliumnext.github.io/Docs/Wiki/mobile-frontend.html).

Notes containing new list bullet points will be saved under your "day note" on your
TriliumNext server.
